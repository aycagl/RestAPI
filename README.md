# **Eco-Friendly Rest API Project**

The **Eco-Friendly Lifestyle** API helps users track eco-conscious habits by logging daily consumption data for food, trash, water, electricity, and transportation. It calculates a carbon footprint score and offers personalized recommendations to promote sustainable living. 

For example:
- Users with high food waste can receive nearby shelter locations for donations (via **Google Maps API**). 
- The API also provides actionable tips to:
  - Reduce trash,
  - Save water,
  - Use energy efficiently,
  - Opt for sustainable transportation alternatives.
